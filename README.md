# ðŸ“Š Customer Churn Prediction

## ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement
Telecom companies struggle with customer retention due to competition. This project predicts whether a customer will churn based on demographics, account information, and services.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Telco Customer Churn dataset.
- Identify patterns and factors that lead to customer churn.
- Prepare dataset for machine learning model building.

## ðŸ—‚ Dataset
- Source: [Kaggle - Telco Customer Churn](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn)
- Shape: 7043 rows Ã— 21 columns

## ðŸ”Ž Steps Completed
1. Data Loading & Cleaning
2. Missing Value Treatment (`TotalCharges`)
3. Univariate Analysis (Categorical vs Churn)
4. Numerical Features vs Churn
5. Correlation Heatmap

## ðŸ“Š Key Insights
- Customers with **month-to-month contracts** have higher churn rates.
- **Tenure** is strongly correlated with churn: new customers churn more.
- **High monthly charges** also increase the chance of churn.

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack
- Python, Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Google Colab

## ðŸš€ Next Steps
- Feature Engineering
- Model Building (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Model Deployment using Streamlit
